# CoffeeMachine

A coffee machine with options to buy single or multiple cups for meetings!
(type selection for multiple cups coming soon, now everyone in the meeting has to have the same type, don't ask me why)

The machine calculates and keeps track of resources like water, milk, coffee beans, cups and money!

Maintenance options to check stock, fill resources and collect money made from sales!

Updates and fixes since first launch:
- Fixed resource management which allowed making coffee from thin air
- Added a cap to resources, resource tanks no longer work on magic and responsible witches were punished by the townsfolk
