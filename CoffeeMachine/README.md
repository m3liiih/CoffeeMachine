# CoffeeMachine

A coffee machine with options to buy single or multiple cups for meetings! 
(type selection for multiple cups coming soon, now everyone in the meeting has to have the same type, don't ask me why)

The machine calculates and keeps track of resources like water, milk, coffee beans, cups and money!
(you can't make coffee from thin air which was recently fixed)

Maintenance options to check stock, fill previosly mentioned resources and collect money!
(added a cap to refill resources so you can't fill the machine with infinite resources to have all the coffee you want which was previously possible)
